## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project helped me to understand more about margin property in css and how to use position: relative property in css. I also get to know more about <div> tag in html and how to insert a img in a box properly with help of css.

### Continued development

Still i was not that good at determining margin values as it was to be used in mobile aswell as in desktop, so i would be focusing more on this property so that i could do such task fast and with accuracy. 

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site helped me in to differenciate between relative and absolute positioning in css. Also was usefull to know more about different css codes.
